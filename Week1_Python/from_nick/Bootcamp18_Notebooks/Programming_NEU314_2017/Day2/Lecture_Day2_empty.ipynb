    "Notebooks allow you to mix text, graphics, and executable code within a single file that can be easily shared. Each notebook is a file (ending in .ipynb) that you open in your browser. Notebooks are composed of chunks called \"cells\", each of which can be code, or can be text. When you add a new cell, the typical default is that it will be a \"code\" cell. To make it a text cell, choose \"markdown.\" Running (i.e., executing) a code cell sends its contents to an underlying Python \"kernel\", which treats it just as if you had typed the contents into a Python console.\n",

    "If you would simply like to know more about a particular function, press `Shift + Tab` while inside the function to bring up a snippet of documentation; press `Tab` again (while still holding `Shift`) to bring up an even larger box of documentation; a third press of `Tab` will turn the bottom half of your screen into a window with the full documentation for your function (including definitions of the function's inputs, outputs, parameters and their default settings, and often some example code!)## (from yesterday, for reference): using Jupyter Notebooks:\n",

    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic principle of clean coding is splitting big problems into cleanly separable smaller chunks, each of which is easier to solve. To do this, you want to make each chunk as independent of the others as possible, so you can debug it and/or modify it without worrying about how it would affect other chunks (or how changing other chunks would affect it). When many pieces of code depend on many other pieces, it becomes what is known as \"spaghetti code\", a.k.a. a mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "### using functions to wrap and seal off chunks of code\n",
    "\n",
    "In **functional programming**, the fact that functions create their own variable namespaces is used to cleanly wrap different chunks of code apart from each other. That is, a variable first declared and used inside a function can be addressed and used only inside the function. It is therefore kept totally separate from some other chunk of code because it can't be used or modified outside the function, even accidentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages enforce such encapsulation pretty strictly: the namespace inside a function is totally separate from that outside. That is, when executing code inside the function you can't access *any* variables that existed outside the function, you only know what was passed as parameters to the function; and *none* of the variables from inside the function are accessible once outside it, values have to be passed to the outside as outputs returned by the function. So communication is strictly controlled: in through known parameters, out through known outputs of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is not like that: encapsulation is not strict.** Which means that you can cut some corners: you can write code that is a little shorter and faster than you could otherwise, but you can also much more easily screw up and write bad code that is a mess to debug. So **be careful**! My recommendation is, that to start you try to write code *that works*. That means write it clean and well-encapsulated. Once you've debugged it, and it all works as you thought it would, then maybe you can try cutting some corners for efficiency.\n",

    "2. Never mutate parameters passed to a function. That way you'll never get tripped up by a variable unexpectedly changing value without you noticing, because you forgot that you were mutating it inside a function you called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document your function properly, so that the effects of the function are fully described by what is in there, and only use what is described there. That way, you can change the inside of the function (debug, make more efficient, implement however you want), and as long as it still matches the documentation, none of your other code should be affected in any way: you will have successfully *encapuslated* the code inside the function. \"Proper\" documentation means:\n",
    "    1. Describe what the function does\n",
    "    2. List out all the parameters to the function, and what format those should be in (e.g., if a parameters needs to be an integer, then say so; etc.)\n",
    "    3. List out all the outputs of the function, and what format those take.\n",
    "    4. The function is then defined by the (parameter input)->(output results) transformation. As long as that stays constant, you can rewrite the function any way you want and none of your other code will break. (Note that some functions, like those that print something to the screen, or functions that produce some graphics, like the turtle graphics we've been using, have an effect that isn't part of the value the function returns.)\n",
