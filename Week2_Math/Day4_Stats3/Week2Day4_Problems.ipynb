The disease is relatively rare in this population, with a prevalence of 0.2% (meaning it affects 2 out of every 1,000 persons). The physician recommends a screening test that costs \\$250 and requires a blood sample. Before agreeing to the screening test, the patient wants to know what will be learned from the test, specifically **what is the true positive rate of the test, defined as the probability of disease, given a positive test result?**, i.e., $P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{screen positive})$.\n",

The test correctly diagnosed 55% of the mal-adjusted soldiers as mal-adjusted, and incorrectly diagnosed only 19% of the adjusted soldiers.
