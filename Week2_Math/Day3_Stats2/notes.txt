histogram vs population
if our sample went out to the edge of the distribution, would it be definitely outside the distribution?
before two-tailed: why didn't we just stop with conclusion when we saw point inside the distribution
we could generalize without human
color changtes
replace words with symbols
dont mention normality distribution - just a single mention and link to give the caveat
distribution is singular
negative firing rates
label axes of 30 Hz
instead of colored block hoistograms for sampling example, use short-block bars instrad
in animation of sampling: bottom in dif scale than top - first without dif scale, then change it

talking about sampling and our sample
don't use "sample" for the draws from the population, the indivudal "experiments" or "draws"

comment on when we leave simulation world

branch out the the bottom half for an additional thing - with one single sample and its associated t distribution

t distribution should be defined
degrees of freedom
possibly remove the ddof

dont even include code you dont want them to use/see/understand

problem by problem make sure students reach next question together in afternoon

---general notes
very specific wording for each thing that gets mentioned - like distributions specifically
no short-hands

do regressions on day 3
